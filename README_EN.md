This is a BSP support package for art-pi based on STM32 Hal. The software used is stm32cubeide 1.5.1. The related project files were not uploaded because it may involve personal privacy and inconvenient to transplant. Each support package has its own comments to help you configure the stm32cubeide project. If you also use Hal, it can be easily transplanted
